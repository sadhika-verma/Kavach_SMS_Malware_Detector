# Kavach_SMS_Malware_Detector
SMS Malware Detector using Python
Technology used:
MALICIOUS URL LINK DETECTOR: SMS 
This program has been written in python that implements the detection of malware in SMS messages in two methods:
First, it scans the message for URLs and uses the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pranjal-tiwarigithub/Kavach-23/main/urlhaus.abuse.ch.csv database taken from https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/api/#csv . The database itself contains approximately thirty thousand malicious links.
In addition to detection by already found URL links, the program also scans through the message to detect words that are considered malicious from a list.
Working of program:
FUNCTIONS USED ALONG WITH EXPLANATION:
main(): this function initiates the code by asking user for the malicious SMS input and calls the function detect_sms
detect_sms(message): this function contains a if else condition that calls the two functions that check if the message contains malware. If its true it prints MALICIOUS and if false it prints CLEAN
contains_malacious_word(message): is the function that compares the words in the message to the malicious words list. It compares the words in the list by a for loop and the message is broken down into words by using the function word_tokenize() function and then removing the common words by using the ‘stopwords.words("english”)’ function from the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) that removes the common stopwords from the message and then we use the in operator to scan if the words in the message are present in the list.
contains_malware(message): uses the concept of regular expressions to scan the message for URLs present ad stores them. This function then calls the is_malicious(url) function.
 is_malicious(url): reads the csv file from where we use the if function to compare if the URLs found in the message was contained in the database or not.
print_with_delay(string, delay): is a function that has been added for aesthetics. It prints the text "D E T E C T I N G | M A L W A R E. . ." letter wise slowly that adds an impression that the program is actually thinking to process the program.
How it can be improved:
We can improve this technique by using a database that auto updates itself to make the malware detection more dynamic and recently discovered malware URLs can be appended to the database.
We can also enhance the ability to detect malware messages by using a more sophisticated language processing model that auto detects malicious words instead of using a small pool of words in the list.
